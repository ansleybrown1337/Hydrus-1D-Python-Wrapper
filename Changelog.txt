Update Log:
12/5/18
    -Merged all functions into class.
    -Hyrdrus runs over all iterations, but ECe is not changing (as it should).
     Not sure why.
12/12/18
    -Hydrus completes one iteration successfully, but cannot write output files
    -HydrusRun_ver2 was created to attempt running from H1D_UNSC.EXE directory
    -runs one iteration successfully, and writes complete output files, but
     cannot run the next iteration.
12/18/18
    -Hydrus completes all iterations successfully! Now we need to check the
     quality of the data by plotting some things:
    -ECe v. Gypsum content with colorization for water contents for one soil
    -ECe v. Gypsum content with colorization for water contents for all soils
    New Efficiency Issues:
    -Running graph_output() results in having to run final_data() 4 separate
     times because of the way it is called with self.final_data() in the
     function. There is probably a way to prevent this from happening by saving
     the dataframe after running final_data() just once.
12/20/18
    -Moving a little backwards. We decided it wasn't good to just select the
     first EC from the Equil.out file and instead import all of it, in case in
     the future someone might want to look at the entire soil profile at
     different times. This resulted in changing the _run_batch() function, but
     it's not working properly.
    -_run_batch() creates a giant DataFrame, but should only produce one of 1176
     (294 rows from input * 4 rows from Equil.out = 1,176 rows). Instead we have
     a massive dataframe with 43,932 rows, but we're unsure why.
01/02/2019
    -fixed merge issue. More than one index was needed to merge correctly.
     So instead of merging on just 'soil_type', gypsum and VWC were also merged
     on.
    -consolidated ssat and paste ion values into single columns to allow hydrus
     to run each sample separately.  This will make hydrus simulate a paste, and
     then simulate the field condition without mising ions from both.
    -implemented graph_output() function with customizable x and y values
    -need to improve graph_output() to include separate line fits for paste and
     ssat points
02/11/19
    -need to figure out why NaN's are produced in input dataframe
        -still unknown
    -need to optimize gypsum so that the 1:1 fit is better
        -this might not be the case, I might just take observed values from the
         CSU soils lab for both CaSO4 and CaCO3
    -then I need to compare the same sample at different water contents
        -completed, added this functionality in self._inputs()
02/12/19
    -need to update self.graph_output() so that we can graph different moistures
        -think that faceting would be good?
        -can't figure out why slicing my group isn't working in the graph_output
02/18/19
    -fixed the graphing a bit
        -lost colorization
        -still can't condition by shape
        -can't separate moisture levels
    -maybe I don't need to group anything? I can probably just graph the df
    -DONE: try to include CO2 into datafram as input for paste vs. ssat
        -ambient CO2 (410ppm), ssat CO2 (410*1.05 = 430.5ppm)
        -CO2 is lower in lab water than in soil water
        -Im confused what hydrus CO2 is: ambient or solution?
