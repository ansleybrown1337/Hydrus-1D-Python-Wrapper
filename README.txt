This tool was created to run Monte Carlo analysis in Hydrus 1D (https://www.pc-progress.com/en/Default.aspx?hydrus-1d)
to see the impact of the changing ion concentrations on soil solution electrical
conductivity (EC).

I never created a how-to doc for it unfortunately, and I'm not actively working 
on it, so if you are interested in using this code, please contact me directly at ansleybrown1337@gmail.com.

Cheers,
